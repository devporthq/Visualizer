# Prompt-It Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for **Prompt-It**, a cutting-edge tool that generates 3D models from text prompts using AI. Whether you're building a game, an animation, or just want to experiment with 3D models, this tool is here to help you streamline your creative process. In this documentation, we'll cover everything you need to know to get started, from how it works, to implementation, and how to interact with our API.

## 1. Functionality

At its core, **Prompt-It** leverages the power of artificial intelligence to transform your text prompts into 3D models. This process is driven by sophisticated machine learning algorithms designed to interpret the semantics of the prompt and create geometry that aligns with the description. The AI breaks down the input prompt into key components, identifies relevant features, and then synthesizes a 3D object that matches the given request.

The **functionality** of Prompt-It is simple but highly flexible:

1. **Text to 3D Model**: You provide a text prompt describing the 3D model you'd like to generate. The AI reads your prompt, processes it, and generates a 3D model that aligns with your description.
2. **Model Generation Process**: The model is generated through an AI pipeline that processes your prompt. This typically involves parsing the text for key concepts, generating underlying structure, and then refining the details. The final output is a complete 3D model that can be used in various applications.
3. **Quick and Scalable**: Whether you need a quick prototype or a more refined model, **Prompt-It** scales to your needs. The queue system ensures that multiple requests can be handled without issue, giving you flexibility and speed when working on your project.

The AI uses a unique process to convert the prompt into a fully-formed 3D object, but behind the scenes, it's a combination of advanced natural language processing, computer vision, and procedural generation that makes it all work seamlessly.

### Example Use Case:

Imagine you're working on a game and need a 3D model of a "futuristic sword" for your protagonist. Simply type the prompt, and within minutes, the AI will deliver a model that fits your description. Whether it's a "sci-fi gun" or "medieval castle," Prompt-It can handle a wide range of design challenges.

## 2. How to Implement

Implementing the 3D models generated by **Prompt-It** into other applications is a breeze. Whether you're building a game, creating animations, or working on a virtual reality (VR) experience, the integration process is straightforward.

Here’s how you can implement the generated models into different environments:

### 2.1 Game Engines (e.g., Unity or Unreal Engine)

Once the model is generated and you've received the download link, you can import the model into your favorite game engine, like **Unity** or **Unreal Engine**. Here’s how to do it for Unity:

1. **Download the Model**: After receiving the “Finished” status from the API, follow the download link to get your 3D model.
2. **Import to Unity**:

   * Open your Unity project.
   * Navigate to the **Assets** menu and click on **Import New Asset**.
   * Select the downloaded model file (usually in formats like .obj, .fbx, etc.).
   * Unity will automatically process the model, and you can start using it in your scene.

   For animations, you might need to set up the model's rig and add the necessary animation components depending on the complexity.

### 2.2 Animation Software (e.g., Blender, Maya)

For animators using software like **Blender** or **Maya**, importing the model is as easy as downloading and opening the file.

1. **Download the Model** from the link you get when the status returns as “Finished.”
2. **Import into Software**:

   * In **Blender**, simply go to **File > Import** and select the appropriate file type (e.g., .obj, .fbx).
   * In **Maya**, use **File > Import** to load the file into your project.

   Once imported, you can apply textures, rigging, and other animations to make the model fit your project.

### 2.3 Web Applications (e.g., Three.js)

If you're working on a web-based application and using libraries like **Three.js**, you can load the generated 3D models directly into your project:

1. **Download the Model** from the finished status.
2. **Load the Model in Three.js**:

   ```javascript
   const loader = new THREE.OBJLoader();
   loader.load('path_to_your_model.obj', function (object) {
     scene.add(object);
   });
   ```

   This script will load your .obj model into the scene. Similar methods apply for other file types and libraries like **Babylon.js** or **PlayCanvas**.

By following these steps, you can integrate the generated 3D models into your game, animation, or web application with minimal effort.

## 3. API

The **Prompt-It API** provides two main endpoints for generating models and checking the status of your requests. To get started, you’ll need an API key, which can be obtained after registering on **prompt-it.fun**.

### 3.1 Endpoints

* **Generate Model**
  **POST** `prompt-it.fun/api/generate`
  This endpoint accepts a prompt and API key, and it returns a request ID that can be used to track the status of the model generation.

  **Request Parameters**:

  * **prompt** (string): The textual description of the model to generate.
  * **api\_key** (string): Your unique API key.

  **Example Request**:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST "https://prompt-it.fun/api/generate" -d "prompt=A futuristic sword" -d "api_key=your_api_key"
  ```

  **Response**:

  ```json
  {
    "request_id": "12345abcde"
  }
  ```

  Once the request ID is received, you can use it to check the status of your model.

* **Check Status**
  **GET** `prompt-it.fun/api/status`
  This endpoint takes the request ID and API key, returning the status of the model generation process.

  **Request Parameters**:

  * **request\_id** (string): The ID of your model generation request.
  * **api\_key** (string): Your unique API key.

  **Example Request**:

  ```bash
  curl "https://prompt-it.fun/api/status?request_id=12345abcde&api_key=your_api_key"
  ```

  **Response**:

  ```json
  {
    "status": "Finished",
    "download_link": "https://prompt-it.fun/download/3d_model.obj"
  }
  ```

  **Status Codes**:

  * **Queued**: The generation request is in the queue.
  * **Generating**: The model is being processed.
  * **Error**: Something went wrong during the model generation.
  * **Finished**: The model is successfully generated. A download link will be provided for the 3D model.

### 3.2 Example Workflow

1. You make a **POST** request to the `generate` endpoint with your prompt and API key.
2. After the request is queued, you make a **GET** request to check the status.
3. When the status returns **Finished**, you receive a download link for the model.
